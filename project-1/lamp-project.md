# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION IN AWS

## LAMP STACK 


In this Project, we will be implementing Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) in six easy steps. 

## Prerequisites 
- An AWS Account 
- Basic understanding of Linux (chown & chmod commands)
- basic text editing skills in vi

### Step 1 - Launch an EC2 Instance

- Launch a new EC2 Instance with t2 micro family and with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS

- Create a new keypair - * It is important to save your private key (.pem file) securely *

- ensure you allow ssh traffic into your instance from ** Anywhere **

### Connect to your EC2 Instance (using MAC/Linux)

- open your terminal and cd into the directory where your .pem file is saved.
- to avoid a "bad permission" error, change the permissions for the private key file by running:

` sudo chmod 0400 <private-key-name>. pem `

- connect to your instance by running:

` ssh -i <private-key-name>. pem ubuntu@<Public-IP-address> `

Great! We've just launched our instance and connected to it, our set up looks like this now:

### Step 2 - Installing Apache and updating the firewall

> Install Apache using Ubuntuâ€™s package manager * apt *

- update a list of packages in package manage by running

`sudo apt update`

- run apache2 package installation 

`sudo apt install apache2`

- To verify that apache2 is running as a Service in our OS, use following command

`sudo systemctl status apache2`

*if it is green and running, then you did everything correctly - Yaay! You have just launched your first Web Server in the Clouds*

Now let us check how we can access our server locally in our Ubuntu shell, run:

`curl http://localhost:80`

You should get something like this.

Now it is time for us to test how our Apache HTTP server can respond to requests from the Internet. Open a web browser of your choice and try to access following url http://<Public-IP-Address>:80


Your browser should look like this:

## Step 3 - Installing MySQL



## Step 4 - Installing PHP 

## Step 5 - Creating a virtual host for our website using apache

## Step 6 - Enabling PHP on the website
